# Linear-Regression-Analysis

An insurance company wants to develop a model to predict the annual medical claims made by its customers. The data analytic team of the company assumes that the following variables may be useful in predicting the annual medical claims made by a given policyholder.
1. age : age of the policyholder
2. gender : the policyholderâ€™s gender - female, male
3. bmi : body mass index of the policyholder
4. num dependents : number of dependents covered by the health insurance (spouse and
children below age 18)
5. is smoker : smoking status of the policyholder - yes, no
6. working env : working environment of the policyholder - construction site, factory,
office
7. tot claims : total amount of claims made by the policyholder

In order to predict the annual medical claims, I have developed a multiple linear regression model.
